## 1. Prerequisites
1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
Ubuntu  20.04.
ROS noetic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
additional ROS pacakge
```
    sudo apt-get install ros-YOUR_DISTRO-cv-bridge ros-YOUR_DISTRO-tf ros-YOUR_DISTRO-message-filters ros-YOUR_DISTRO-image-transport
```


1.2. **Ceres Solver**
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html), remember to **make install**.
(Our testing environment: Ubuntu 20.04, ROS noetic, OpenCV 3.3.1, Eigen 3.3.3) 

## 2. Build VINS-Mono on ROS
Clone the repository and catkin_make:
```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## 3. Visual-Inertial Odometry and Pose Graph Reuse on Public datasets
Download [EuRoC MAV Dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Although it contains stereo cameras, we only use one camera. The system also works with [ETH-asl cla dataset](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/maplab/multi_session_mapping_CLA/bags/). We take EuRoC as the example.

**3.1 visual-inertial odometry and loop closure**

3.1.1 Open three terminals, launch the vins_estimator , rviz and play the bag file respectively. Take MH_01 for example
```
    roslaunch vins_estimator euroc.launch 
    roslaunch vins_estimator vins_rviz.launch
    rosbag play YOUR_PATH_TO_DATASET/MH_01_easy.bag 
```
(If you fail to open vins_rviz.launch, just open an empty rviz, then load the config file: file -> Open Config-> YOUR_VINS_FOLDER/config/vins_rviz_config.rviz)

3.1.2 (Optional) Visualize ground truth. We write a naive benchmark publisher to help you visualize the ground truth. It uses a naive strategy to align VINS with ground truth. Just for visualization. not for quantitative comparison on academic publications.
```
    roslaunch benchmark_publisher publish.launch  sequence_name:=MH_05_difficult
```
 (Green line is VINS result, red line is ground truth). 
 
3.1.3 (Optional) You can even run EuRoC **without extrinsic parameters** between camera and IMU. We will calibrate them online. Replace the first command with:
```
    roslaunch vins_estimator euroc_no_extrinsic_param.launch
```
**No extrinsic parameters** in that config file.  Waiting a few seconds for initial calibration. Sometimes you cannot feel any difference as the calibration is done quickly.

**3.2 map merge**

After playing MH_01 bag, you can continue playing MH_02 bag, MH_03 bag ... The system will merge them according to the loop closure.

**3.3 map reuse**

3.3.1 map save

Set the **pose_graph_save_path** in the config file (YOUR_VINS_FOLEDER/config/euroc/euroc_config.yaml). After playing MH_01 bag, input **s** in vins_estimator terminal, then **enter**. The current pose graph will be saved. 

3.3.2 map load

Set the **load_previous_pose_graph** to 1 before doing 3.1.1. The system will load previous pose graph from **pose_graph_save_path**. Then you can play MH_02 bag. New sequence will be aligned to the previous pose graph.


## 4. Run with your device 

Suppose you are familiar with ROS and you can get a camera and an IMU with raw metric measurements in ROS topic, you can follow these steps to set up your device. For beginners, we highly recommend you to first try out [VINS-Mobile](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mobile) if you have iOS devices since you don't need to set up anything.

4.1 Change to your topic name in the config file. The image should exceed 20Hz and IMU should exceed 100Hz. Both image and IMU should have the accurate time stamp. IMU should contain absolute acceleration values including gravity.

4.2 Camera calibration:

We support the [pinhole model](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.8/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html) and the [MEI model](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cmei/articles/single_viewpoint_calib_mei_07.pdf). You can calibrate your camera with any tools you like. Just write the parameters in the config file in the right format. If you use rolling shutter camera, please carefully calibrate your camera, making sure the reprojection error is less than 0.5 pixel.

4.3 **Camera-Imu extrinsic parameters**:

If you have seen the config files for EuRoC and AR demos, you can find that we can estimate and refine them online. If you familiar with transformation, you can figure out the rotation and position by your eyes or via hand measurements. Then write these values into config as the initial guess. Our estimator will refine extrinsic parameters online. If you don't know anything about the camera-IMU transformation, just ignore the extrinsic parameters and set the **estimate_extrinsic** to **2**, and rotate your device set at the beginning for a few seconds. When the system works successfully, we will save the calibration result. you can use these result as initial values for next time. An example of how to set the extrinsic parameters is in[extrinsic_parameter_example](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono/blob/master/config/extrinsic_parameter_example.pdf)

4.4 **Temporal calibration**:
Most self-made visual-inertial sensor sets are unsynchronized. You can set **estimate_td** to 1 to online estimate the time offset between your camera and IMU.  

4.5 **Rolling shutter**:
For rolling shutter camera (carefully calibrated, reprojection error under 0.5 pixel), set **rolling_shutter** to 1. Also, you should set rolling shutter readout time **rolling_shutter_tr**, which is from sensor datasheet(usually 0-0.05s, not exposure time). Don't try web camera, the web camera is so awful.

4.6 Other parameter settings: Details are included in the config file.

4.7 Performance on different devices: 

(global shutter camera + synchronized high-end IMU, e.g. VI-Sensor) > (global shutter camera + synchronized low-end IMU) > (global camera + unsync high frequency IMU) > (global camera + unsync low frequency IMU) > (rolling camera + unsync low frequency IMU). 

## 5. Mapping module

 Vox blox mapping module is used to create mesh. Clone the git repo in to the source directory of your workspace
```
    git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
```
Install all the dependencies vox blox requires to build
